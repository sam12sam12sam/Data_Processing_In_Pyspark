Project Description:

This project involves reading data from various sources and formats (ad_impressions data in JSON format, clicks_conversions data in CSV format, and bid_requests data in Avro format) using PySpark. The primary focus is on filtering valid data based on mandatory checks and handling data validation, filtering, and deduplication to standardize and enrich the dataset for transformation. Additionally, it implements logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions to derive meaningful insights. The transformed or processed data is stored into Parquet files, enabling fast querying for campaign performance analysis. Furthermore, an error handling and monitoring system is created to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays, ensuring data quality and reliability.
